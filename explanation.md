# Implementation Explanation

## 1) Project Overview

This repository provides two multilingual OCR training scripts:

| Script | Model | Use Case |
|--------|-------|----------|
| `train_swin_multilingual.py` | Swin Transformer + CTC | High-accuracy production model |
| `train_crnn_multilingual.py` | CRNN + CTC | Lightweight baseline, fast training |

Both scripts share core components for:
- Dataset handling (LMDB/TSV formats)
- Language balancing and split strategies
- Training optimizations (AMP, gradient clipping, schedulers)
- Checkpoint management and resume
- Metrics evaluation (CER, WER, accuracy)

For **how to run** the scripts, see `README.md`. This file covers **how and why** things work.

---

## 2) Dataset Design Decisions

The scripts support two formats (auto-detected):

| Format | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **LMDB** | Fast loading, small size, preserved splits | One-time conversion needed |
| **TSV** | No conversion, human-readable | Slower loading, larger storage |

**Why LMDB is recommended:**
- Memory-mapped access eliminates filesystem overhead
- Single-file structure enables fast dataset transfer
- Index files (`train_index.csv`, etc.) enable instant training startup

**Why TSV is still supported:**
- Original format, no conversion needed
- Easy to inspect/debug
- Good for small datasets or development

### 2.3 TSV Manifest Building

For TSV format datasets, the scripts build a manifest (index) on first run to enable fast loading.

**What is a Manifest?**

A manifest is a cached index of all training samples:
```
metadata/
├── manifest.parquet    # Cached index
├── train_manifest.csv # Per-split indexes
├── val_manifest.csv
└── test_manifest.csv
```

**Manifest Contents:**

For each sample, the manifest stores:
- `key`: Unique identifier (for LMDB key)
- `image_path`: Full path to image file
- `ground_truth`: OCR label text
- `language`: Language code
- `split`: train/val/test

**Column Auto-Detection:**

The script automatically detects TSV column names:

| Preferred | Alternatives |
|-----------|--------------|
| `image_path` | `img_path`, `image`, `path`, `filename`, `file` |
| `ground_truth` | `label`, `text`, `transcription`, `word` |

**Caching:**

The manifest is cached to parquet for faster subsequent runs:
- First run: Full scan of all TSV files
- Later runs: Load from cache (`manifest.parquet`)

**When to Rebuild:**

| Scenario | Action |
|-----------|-------|
| Adding new TSV files | Rebuild |
| Changing dataset structure | Rebuild |
| Updating ground truth labels | Rebuild |
| Manifest is corrupted | Rebuild |

- For rebuild command, see README
- For performance benchmarks, see README Dataset Setup section

**Recommended Workflow:**

1. **Development**: Use TSV (no conversion needed)
2. **Production**: Convert to LMDB (one-time, then fast)
3. **Large datasets**: Always use LMDB

**Split strategy:**
- **LMDB**: Preserved splits from conversion time (consistent across runs)
- **TSV**: Per-language 80/10/10 split (re-split each run, preserves minority languages)

**Language balancing:**
- Weighted sampling for equal language representation
- Hard cap on dominant language ratio before split

### 2.4 Language Balancing Implementation

For multilingual datasets with imbalanced language distributions, language balancing ensures the model learns from all languages equally.

**Why Language Balancing Matters:**

Without balancing, the model may:
- Overfit to dominant language (e.g., 80% English samples)
- Ignore minority languages entirely
- Produce poor predictions for underrepresented scripts

**Two Balancing Strategies:**

#### Strategy 1: Weighted Sampling (--balance-languages)

Enables weighted sampling where each sample's probability is inversely proportional to language frequency:

```python
# Key concept: Weight = total / (n_languages * language_count)
# This gives equal probability to each language regardless of size
```

**Example:**
```
Dataset: English (8000), Hindi (1000), Arabic (1000)
Without balancing: P(English)=0.8, P(Hindi)=0.1, P(Arabic)=0.1
With balancing: All languages have equal sampling probability (0.333)
```
- Keeps all samples (none removed)
- Equal sampling probability per language
- For CLI commands, see README

#### Strategy 2: Hard Cap (--max-dominant-to-second-ratio)

Limits the ratio between the largest and second-largest language:

```python
# Key concept: max_allowed = second_largest * max_ratio
# Randomly sample down dominant language to this limit
```

**Example:**
```
Dataset: English (8000), Hindi (1000), Arabic (1000)
--max-dominant-to-second-ratio 1.5
Result: English capped at 1500 (1000 * 1.5)
```
- Removes samples from dominant language
- Preserves ratio while reducing size
- For CLI commands, see README

**When to Use Which:**

| Scenario | Recommended Approach |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Equal importance to all languages | `--balance-languages` |
| Limit dominant language but keep most data | `--max-dominant-to-second-ratio` |
| Both strategies desired | Use both flags together |

**Important Notes:**

1. Language balancing is applied **before** train/val/test split
2. Weighted sampling doesn't remove data (keeps all samples)
3. Ratio cap removes samples from dominant language only
4. Check `train_index.csv` to see final language distribution
5. For CLI commands, see README

## 3) Design Philosophy and Trade-offs

### 3.1 Design Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Simplicity** | No complex augmentation, standard components |
| **Reproducibility** | Fixed seeds, complete checkpoints |
| **Robustness** | Skip corrupt images, early stopping, graceful edge cases |

### 3.1.1 Corrupt Image Handling

The training scripts automatically skip corrupt/unreadable images instead of crashing, ensuring training continues even with problematic data.

**Why Skip Instead of Crash?**

Corrupt images in large multilingual datasets can be caused by:
- File system issues during dataset creation
- Image encoding errors in source files
- Missing or truncated image data
- Permission issues

**How It Works:**

```python
def __getitem__(self, idx):
    try:
        # Normal loading
        image = self._load_image(idx)
        return image, label, 0  # 0 = not skipped
    except Exception as e:
        # Log and skip
        self._log_skipped_image(idx, str(e), self.split_name)
        return None, label, 1  # 1 = skipped
```

**What Gets Logged:**

Each skipped image is logged to:
```
logs/skipped_images/skipped_{worker_id}.csv
```

**Log format:**
| key | error_type | error_message | split |
|-----|----------|-------------|-------|
| hindi_001.jpg | IOError | Cannot identify image file | train |
| arabic_002.png | OSError | file truncated | train |

**Aggregated Summary:**

After training, a summary is created at:
```
logs/skipped_images_summary.csv
```

**Summary format:**
| split | error_type | count | examples |
|-------|-----------|-------|----------|
| train | IOError | 5 | hindi_001.jpg, ... |
| val | OSError | 2 | arabic_002.png, ... |

- For how to check skipped images, see README

**Why Not Crash?**

1. Single corrupt image shouldn't stop entire training
2. Small number of corrupt images won't affect model quality
3. Logs enable fix later if needed

**Important Notes:**

- Skipped images don't contribute to training loss
- Count is logged but model continues
- Fix source files to include in future runs

### 3.2 Trade-off Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Swin over ViT | Shifted windows more efficient than full attention |
| CRNN as baseline | Proven, simple, fast - good comparison point |
| CTC over attention | Works without alignment, variable length |
| ReduceLROnPlateau | Adaptive - handles noisy OCR loss curves |
| LMDB format | Dramatically faster than file-based loading |
| No augmentation | Reproducibility, CTC is naturally robust |

---

## 4) Model Architecture Deep Dive

### 4.1 Swin Transformer + CTC (SwinCTC)

**Why Swin Transformer for OCR?**

Swin Transformer was chosen over traditional CNNs for the following reasons:

1. **Global attention mechanism**: Unlike CNNs which have local receptive fields, Swin's shifted window attention can capture long-range dependencies in text images
2. **Hierarchical features**: Swin produces multi-scale features (stage 1-4) which is beneficial for text of varying sizes
3. **State-of-the-art**: Swin-T offers excellent accuracy/compute tradeoff on vision tasks

**Architecture Code:**

```python
class SwinCTC(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes: int):
        super().__init__()
        # swin_t = Tiny Swin Transformer (~28M params)
        # weights=None: random init (training from scratch)
        self.backbone = swin_t(weights=None)
        
        # Projection: 768-dim (Swin-T output) -> num_classes
        # 768 comes from Swin-T's hidden dimension
        self.proj = nn.Linear(768, num_classes)

    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        # Input: [batch, 3, 48, 224] (RGB images)
        
        # Extract features through Swin backbone
        # Output: [batch, patches, 768] 
        feat = self.backbone.features(x)
        
        # Apply layer normalization
        feat = self.backbone.norm(feat)
        
        # Global average pooling over spatial dimensions
        # [batch, 768] - collapsed sequence
        feat = feat.mean(dim=1)
        
        # Project to CTC classes
        # [batch, num_classes] -> [seq_len, batch, num_classes]
        logits = self.proj(feat)
        return logits.permute(1, 0, 2)
```

**Tensor Shape Flow:**

```
Input Image:     [batch, 3, 48, 224]
    ↓
Swin Features:   [batch, 49, 768]   (7x7 patches from last stage)
    ↓
Norm:            [batch, 49, 768]
    ↓
Mean Pool:       [batch, 768]       (spatial collapse)
    ↓
Linear Proj:     [batch, num_classes]
    ↓
Permute:         [seq_len, batch, num_classes]
                  (seq_len=1 for CTC)
```

**Why output seq_len=1?**

The Swin model collapses spatial information into a single vector via global average pooling. While this loses sequential information (which matters for long text), it's a design choice for simplicity. For longer text, a different architecture (CNN+BiLSTM or Swin with sequence output) would be better.

### 4.1.1 Swin Layer Breakdown

**Stage-wise Architecture:**

| Stage | #Swin Blocks | Channels | Attention Heads | Output Size |
|-------|--------------|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| Patch Embed | 1 | 96 | - | H/4 × W/4 |
| Stage 1 | 2 | 96 | 3 | H/4 × W/4 |
| Stage 2 | 2 | 192 | 6 | H/8 × W/8 |
| Stage 3 | 6 | 384 | 12 | H/16 × W/16 |
| Stage 4 | 2 | 768 | 24 | H/32 × W/32 |

**Feature Map Dimensions:**

| Stage | Spatial (H×W) | Channels |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| Input | 48×224 | 3 (RGB) |
| Stage 1 | 12×56 | 96 |
| Stage 2 | 6×28 | 192 |
| Stage 3 | 3×14 | 384 |
| Stage 4 | 1×7 | 768 |

**Parameter Count (~28M total):**

| Component | Parameters | Percentage |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Patch Embed | ~9K | 0.03% |
| Stage 1 (2 blocks) | ~3.4M | 12% |
| Stage 2 (2 blocks) | ~12.5M | 45% |
| Stage 3 (6 blocks) | ~11.2M | 40% |
| Stage 4 (2 blocks) | ~0.9M | 3% |
| Final Norm + AvgPool | ~2K | 0.01% |
| Linear Projection | ~2M | ~7% |

**Activation Functions:**

| Layer | Activation | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Swin Block | GELU | Gaussian Error Linear Unit |
| MLP | GELU | Two FC layers |
| Layer Norm | None | No activation (normalization) |
| Final Pool | None | Average pooling |

**Key Swin Concepts:**

- **Window Attention**: 7×7 fixed window splits input
- **Shifted Windows**: Alternating shift by 3 pixels
- **Relative Position Bias**: Learnable positional encoding
- **MLP Ratio**: 4× hidden dimension (3072 for 768)

### 4.2 CRNN Architecture

**Why CRNN for OCR?**

1. **Lightweight**: Much fewer parameters than Swin (~5M vs ~28M)
2. **Fast inference**: Single forward pass, no attention complexity
3. **Proven**: CRNN+CTC is the standard baseline for scene text recognition
4. **Simple**: Easy to train, debug, and understand

**CNN Stack Design (Height Compression):**

```python
self.cnn = nn.Sequential(
    # Block 1: 1 -> 64 features, height / 2
    nn.Conv2d(1, 64, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1),
    nn.ReLU(True),
    nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2),  # 48 -> 24 height
    
    # Block 2: 64 -> 128 features, height / 4
    nn.Conv2d(64, 128, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1),
    nn.ReLU(True),
    nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2),  # 24 -> 12 height
    
    # Block 3: 128 -> 256 features, height / 4
    nn.Conv2d(256, 256, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1),
    nn.BatchNorm2d(256),
    nn.ReLU(True),
    nn.Conv2d(256, 256, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1),
    nn.ReLU(True),
    nn.MaxPool2d((2, 1), (2, 1)),  # height / 2, width preserved
    
    # Block 4: 256 -> 512 features, height / 8
    nn.Conv2d(256, 512, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1),
    nn.BatchNorm2d(512),
    nn.ReLU(True),
    nn.Conv2d(512, 512, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1),
    nn.ReLU(True),
    nn.MaxPool2d((2, 1), (2, 1)),  # height / 2, width preserved
    
    # Block 5: 256 -> 512 features, height / 8
    nn.Conv2d(512, 512, kernel_size=2, stride=1, padding=0),
    nn.BatchNorm2d(512),
    nn.ReLU(True),
)
```

**CNN Output Shape Calculation:**

For input 32×128:
- Block 1: MaxPool2d(2,2) → 16×64
- Block 2: MaxPool2d(2,2) → 8×32
- Block 3: MaxPool2d((2,1),(2,1)) → 4×32
- Block 4: MaxPool2d((2,1),(2,1)) → 2×32
- Block 5: Conv2d(2,1) → 1×31

Final: [batch, 512, 1, 31] → squeeze height → [31, batch, 512]

**BiLSTM Stack:**

```python
self.rnn = nn.Sequential(
    # First LSTM: 512 -> 256 (bidirectional = 512 total)
    BidirectionalLSTM(512, 256, 256),
    # Second LSTM: 256 -> 256 (bidirectional = 512 total)
    BidirectionalLSTM(256, 256, num_classes),
)
```

```python
class BidirectionalLSTM(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size: int, hidden_size: int, output_size: int):
        super().__init__()
        self.rnn = nn.LSTM(
            input_size, hidden_size, 
            bidirectional=True, batch_first=True
        )
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size * 2, output_size)

    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        out, _ = self.rnn(x)
        return self.fc(out)
```

**Full Forward Pass:**

```
Input:              [batch, 1, 32, 128]
    ↓
CNN Stack:         [batch, 512, 1, 31]
    ↓
Squeeze Height:    [31, batch, 512]  (seq_len, batch, features)
    ↓
Permute:           [batch, 31, 512]  (batch, seq_len, features)
    ↓
BiLSTM 1:          [batch, 31, 256]
    ↓
BiLSTM 2:          [batch, 31, num_classes]
    ↓
Permute:           [31, batch, num_classes] (for CTC)
```

**Why height must be 1 before LSTM?**

The assert ensures the CNN properly compresses height:
```python
_, _, height, _ = conv.size()
if height != 1:
    raise RuntimeError(f"CNN output height must be 1, got {height}")
```

### 4.2.1 CRNN Layer Breakdown

**CNN Block Architecture:**

| Block | Layers | Input Ch | Output Ch | Spatial Reduction |
|-------|--------|---------|-----------|------------------|
| Block 1 | Conv + ReLU + Pool | 1 | 64 | H/2 × W/2 |
| Block 2 | Conv + ReLU + Pool | 64 | 128 | H/4 × W/4 |
| Block 3 | 2×Conv + 2×ReLU + Pool | 128 | 256 | H/8 × W/8 |
| Block 4 | 2×Conv + 2×ReLU + Pool | 256 | 512 | H/16 × W/16 |
| Block 5 | Conv + BatchNorm + ReLU | 512 | 512 | H/16 × (W-1) |

**Feature Map Depths (32×128 input):**

| Block | Input Size | Channels | Output Size |
|-------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Input | 32×128 | 1 | 32×128 |
| Block 1 | 32×128 | 64 | 16×64 |
| Block 2 | 16×64 | 128 | 8×32 |
| Block 3 | 8×32 | 256 | 4×32 |
| Block 4 | 4×32 | 512 | 2×32 |
| Block 5 | 2×32 | 512 | 1×31 |

**Parameter Count (~5M total):**

| Layer | Parameters | Percentage |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| Block 1 (Conv 3×3) | 1,728 | 0.03% |
| Block 2 (Conv 3×3) | 73,728 | 1.4% |
| Block 3 (2×Conv 3×3 + BN) | ~590K | 11% |
| Block 4 (2×Conv 3×3 + BN) | ~2.4M | 45% |
| Block 5 (Conv 2×2 + BN) | ~1.0M | 19% |
| BiLSTM Layer 1 (256 hidden) | ~790K | 15% |
| BiLSTM Layer 2 (256 hidden) | ~525K | 10% |

**BiLSTM Specifications:**

| Layer | Input | Hidden | Directions | Output |
|-------|-------|--------|------------|---------|
| LSTM 1 | 512 | 256 | 2 (bidirectional) | 256 |
| LSTM 2 | 256 | 256 | 2 (bidirectional) | num_classes |

**Activation Functions:**

| Layer | Activation | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Conv layers | ReLU | After each convolution |
| BatchNorm | None | Normalization only |
| LSTM | tanh (internal) | Cell uses tanh |
| Dropout | None | Not in default config |

**Key CRNN Concepts:**

- **Height Compression**: CNN reduces height from 32→1
- **Sequential Output**: Each column = 1 time step
- **Bidirectional**: Processes both directions for context
- **CTC Ready**: Output [seq, batch, classes] format

---

This is critical because RNNs expect sequence data (time major), and height=1 means each column represents a time step.

### 4.3 Architecture Comparison

| Aspect | SwinCTC | CRNN |
|--------|---------|------|
| Parameters | ~28M | ~5M |
| VRAM (batch=32) | ~3GB | ~1GB |
| Inference speed | Slower | Faster |
| Accuracy | Higher | Lower |
| Attention mechanism | Yes (shifted windows) | No |
| Sequential建模 | Pooled (single vector) | BiLSTM (full sequence) |
| Best for | High accuracy tasks | Resource-constrained |

---

## 5) Training Configuration Rationale

### 5.1 Hyperparameter Choices

**Why Image Size 48×224 for Swin?**

```
Aspect ratio consideration:
- Text images are typically wide (more width than height)
- 48 height: enough vertical resolution for character features
- 224 width: accommodates 10-30+ characters at ~7px/char
- Total pixels: 10,752 (much smaller than 224×224 = 50,176)

Trade-offs:
- Larger = more VRAM, slower training
- Smaller = might lose fine-grained character details
- 48×224 is a sweet spot for multilingual text
```

**Why Image Size 32×128 for CRNN?**

```
CRNN is more compact:
- 32 height: sufficient for CNN to compress to height=1
- 128 width: adequate for 5-15 characters
- Total pixels: 4,096 (even smaller than Swin)

Why smaller than Swin?
- CRNN is designed to be lightweight
- Smaller images = faster training
- Trade-off: slightly lower accuracy
```

**Why Batch Size 32 for both Swin and CRNN?**

```
Swin batch=32:
- Swin-T is larger (~28M params)
- Forward+backward activations are memory-heavy
- 32 is conservative, fits in 8GB VRAM

CRNN batch=32:
- CRNN is smaller (~5M params)
- Default kept conservative for consistency
- With AMP, can double/triple batch size
```

**Epochs:**

| Model | Default | Rationale |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| Swin | 60 | Larger model learns faster per epoch |
| CRNN | 100 | Smaller model needs more epochs |

### 5.2 Learning Rate Selection

**Why 1e-4 for AdamW?**

```python
optimizer = optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=1e-4, weight_decay=1e-4)
```

**Rationale:**
- 1e-4 is the standard starting LR for AdamW on vision tasks
- Too high (>1e-3): training unstable, loss diverges
- Too low (<1e-5): training very slow, might converge to poor local minimum
- 1e-4 works well for both Swin and CRNN

**Weight Decay: 1e-4**

- Moderate regularization
- Prevents overfitting without hurting convergence
- Standard for AdamW (different from Adam's default 0)

### 5.3 Early Stopping Configuration

**Why patience=8?**

```python
patience: int = 8  # Wait 8 epochs without improvement before stopping
```

**Rationale:**
- Too small (2-3): might stop too early, missing better convergence
- Too large (15+): wastes compute on plateau
- 8 is a balanced choice:
  - OCR loss curves can be noisy
  - 8 epochs = reasonable wait time
  - Combined with LR reduction (patience=3), provides good escape from plateaus

---

## 6) CTC Loss Deep Dive

### 6.1 Why CTC for OCR?

**Traditional vs CTC:**

```
Traditional approach:
- Requires alignment between input frames and target characters
- Need to know which frame corresponds to which character
- Infeasible for variable-length text

CTC (Connectionist Temporal Classification):
- No alignment needed
- Learns to collapse repeated characters and blanks
- Works with variable-length input and output
```

**CTC Example:**

```
Input sequence (frames):  [a, a, a, b, b, c, c, c, -, -]
Target text:             "abc"
CTC decoding:            collapse(aaa) + collapse(bb) + collapse(ccc) + collapse(-) = "abc"
                          = remove blanks + merge repeats
```

### 6.2 CTC Loss Configuration

```python
criterion = nn.CTCLoss(blank=0, reduction="mean", zero_infinity=True)
```

**Why blank=0?**

- Index 0 is reserved for the "blank" token (no character)
- CTC uses blank to handle repeated characters
- 0 is the standard convention (works with vocab where 0 = blank)

**Why reduction="mean"?**

- Options: "none", "mean", "sum"
- "mean": average loss over batch (standard)
- "sum": total loss (useful for weighted batches)
- "none": return per-sample losses (debugging)

**Why zero_infinity=True?**

```python
# Without zero_infinity=True:
# If target length > input length, loss = inf
# This causes NaN in gradients, crashes training

# With zero_infinity=True:
# If target length > input length, loss = 0
# Training continues, sample is essentially "impossible"
```

This prevents NaN crashes on edge cases.

### 6.3 CTC Decoding Algorithm

```python
def decode_batch(log_probs, idx_to_char, blank_idx=0):
    """Greedy CTC decoding (used in training scripts)."""
    # log_probs: [seq_len, batch, num_classes]
    preds = log_probs.permute(1, 0, 2).argmax(2)  # [batch, seq_len]
    
    decoded = []
    for b in range(preds.size(0)):
        chars = []
        prev = None
        for t in range(preds.size(1)):
            idx = int(preds[b, t].item())
            # Keep character if: not blank, not same as previous, in vocab
            if idx != blank_idx and idx != prev and idx in idx_to_char:
                chars.append(idx_to_char[idx])
            prev = idx
        decoded.append("".join(chars))
    return decoded
```

**Greedy vs Beam Search:**

| Method | Description | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Greedy | Take argmax at each step | Fast, standard for training |
| Beam | Keep top-k paths, choose best | Better accuracy, slower |

The scripts use greedy decoding (faster, sufficient for most cases).

## 7) Optimizer and Scheduler Deep Dive

### 7.1 Why AdamW over SGD/Adam?

```python
optimizer = optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=1e-4, weight_decay=1e-4)
```

**AdamW vs Adam:**

```
Adam:
- Uses momentum and adaptive learning rates
- weight_decay is implemented as L2 regularization (during gradient computation)
- Can be less effective for deep networks

AdamW (Adam with Weight Decay):
- Decoupled weight decay (applied to parameters, not gradients)
- Better generalization than Adam
- Now the standard optimizer for Transformers and CNNs
```

**AdamW vs SGD:**

```
SGD:
- Simple, requires tuning
- Often achieves better final accuracy with proper scheduling
- Requires learning rate warmup and decay

AdamW:
- Adaptive, less sensitive to LR choice
- No warmup needed (usually)
- Slightly lower final accuracy but more stable training
```

For multilingual OCR with noisy CTC loss curves, AdamW's stability is preferred over SGD's potential for better but less consistent results.

### 7.2 ReduceLROnPlateau Configuration

```python
scheduler = optim.lr_scheduler.ReduceLROnPlateau(
    optimizer,
    mode="min",        # Minimize validation loss
    factor=0.5,        # Halve LR when triggered
    patience=3,        # Wait 3 epochs without improvement
    min_lr=1e-6,       # Minimum LR (don't go below this)
)
```

**Why ReduceLROnPlateau?**

```
Alternative schedulers:
- StepLR: Fixed schedule (e.g., epoch 30, 60)
- CosineAnnealing: Smooth decay
- CyclicLR: Oscillating LR

ReduceLROnPlateau advantages for OCR:
- CTC loss can be noisy (doesn't decrease smoothly)
- Adaptive: reduces LR only when truly stuck
- No manual schedule tuning needed
```

**Why patience=3?**

```
Too aggressive (patience=1):
- Might reduce LR too quickly
- Could stop before true plateau

Too passive (patience=10):
- Wastes compute waiting
- Might overshoot best LR

3 is a balanced choice:
- Enough time to distinguish noise from real plateau
- Quick enough to not waste compute
```

**Why factor=0.5?**

```
Halving the LR is standard:
- Large enough to escape plateau
- Small enough to not destabilize training
- 0.3-0.5 is the typical range
```

**Why min_lr=1e-6?**

```
At min_lr, model is essentially fine-tuning:
- Large changes unlikely
- Further reductions have minimal impact
- 1e-6 is low enough to allow extensive fine-tuning
- Prevents complete convergence stall
```

## 8) Data Pipeline Deep Dive

### 8.1 OCRDataset Implementation

```python
class OCRDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(
        self,
        frame: pd.DataFrame,  # DataFrame with key, ground_truth, language
        img_height: int,
        img_width: int,
        split_name: str,
        skipped_log_dir: Optional[Path] = None,
        lmdb_path: Optional[Path] = None,
    ):
        self.frame = frame.reset_index(drop=True)
        self.split_name = split_name
        self.skipped_log_dir = skipped_log_dir
        self.lmdb_path = lmdb_path
        self.lmdb_env = None
        self.tf = transforms.Compose([
            transforms.Resize((img_height, img_width)),
            transforms.ToTensor(),
        ])

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.frame)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        # Lazy LMDB open (first access only)
        if self.lmdb_path is not None and self.lmdb_env is None:
            self.lmdb_env = lmdb.open(
                str(self.lmdb_path),
                readonly=True,
                lock=False,
                readahead=False,
            )

        row = self.frame.iloc[idx]
        
        if self.lmdb_env is not None:
            # Load from LMDB
            with self.lmdb_env.begin() as txn:
                img_bytes = txn.get(f"{row['key']}.img".encode("utf-8"))
                image = Image.open(io.BytesIO(img_bytes)).convert("RGB")
        else:
            # Load from file path (TSV format)
            image = Image.open(row["image_path"]).convert("RGB")

        # Transform to tensor
        image = self.tf(image)
        label = row["ground_truth"]
        return image, label, 0  # 0 = not skipped
```

### 8.2 Why No Data Augmentation?

**Current pipeline:**
- Resize to fixed size
- ToTensor (normalize to [0,1])

**Why this simplicity?**

1. **Reproducibility**: Augmentation adds randomness, makes reproduction harder
2. **CTC robustness**: CTC naturally handles slight variations in character position
3. **Dataset already diverse**: Multilingual dataset has natural variation
4. **Debugging**: Simpler pipeline = easier to debug issues

**If augmentation needed later:**
- Geometric: Random rotation (±5°), random perspective
- Color: Random brightness/contrast (for document images, less relevant)
- Implement with `transforms.RandomChoice` or custom collate function

### 8.3 LMDB Loading Strategy

**Why lazy open?**

```python
# In __getitem__:
if self.lmdb_path is not None and self.lmdb_env is None:
    self.lmdb_env = lmdb.open(...)
```

- Dataset `__init__` doesn't open LMDB (fast instantiation)
- First `__getitem__` opens it (lazy)
- Worker init function can also open (see next section)

**Transaction per image:**

```python
with self.lmdb_env.begin() as txn:
    img_bytes = txn.get(key)
```

- Each image read = one transaction
- Works but not optimal for throughput
- Alternative: keep transaction open across multiple reads

### 8.4 Worker LMDB Connection

```python
def _init_worker_lmdb(worker_id):
    """Initialize LMDB environment for each DataLoader worker."""
    worker = get_worker_info()
    if worker is None:
        return
    dataset = worker.dataset
    if dataset.lmdb_path is not None:
        dataset.lmdb_env = lmdb.open(
            str(dataset.lmdb_path),
            readonly=True,
            lock=False,
            readahead=False,
        )
```

**Why per-worker connections?**

```
Problem: LMDB connections are not thread-safe
Solution: Each DataLoader worker opens its own connection

Without worker init:
- Main process opens LMDB
- Workers try to use same connection -> errors/crashes

With worker init:
- Worker 0 opens train.lmdb for itself
- Worker 1 opens train.lmdb for itself
- Each has independent connection
```

## 9) Evaluation Metrics Deep Dive

### 9.1 Levenshtein Distance

```python
def levenshtein_distance(s1, s2):
    """Compute Levenshtein distance between two strings."""
    if len(s1) < len(s2):
        return levenshtein_distance(s2, s1)
    if len(s2) == 0:
        return len(s1)

    previous_row = range(len(s2) + 1)
    for i, c1 in enumerate(s1):
        current_row = [i + 1]
        for j, c2 in enumerate(s2):
            insertions = previous_row[j + 1] + 1
            deletions = current_row[j] + 1
            substitutions = previous_row[j] + (c1 != c2)
            current_row.append(min(insertions, deletions, substitutions))
        previous_row = current_row
    return previous_row[-1]
```

**Example:**
```
Reference: "hello"
Hypothesis: "hallo"

Operations:
- h -> h (match, cost 0)
- e -> a (substitute, cost 1)
- l -> l (match, cost 0)
- l -> l (match, cost 0)
- o -> o (match, cost 0)

Levenshtein distance = 1
```

### 9.2 Character Error Rate (CER)

```python
def cer(reference: str, hypothesis: str) -> float:
    if len(reference) == 0:
        return 0.0
    return levenshtein_distance(reference, hypothesis) / len(reference)
```

**Why divide by reference length?**

```
Normalization:
- Raw distance: 5 errors
- Reference "hello": 5/5 = 1.0 (100% error)
- Reference "verylongword": 5/12 = 0.42 (42% error)

Same errors, different text lengths -> different CER
Division makes it comparable
```

**CER Interpretation:**
- 0.0 = perfect (no errors)
- 1.0 = completely wrong (all characters wrong)
- Lower is better

### 9.3 Word Error Rate (WER)

```python
def wer(reference: str, hypothesis: str) -> float:
    ref_words = reference.split()
    hyp_words = hypothesis.split()
    if len(ref_words) == 0:
        return 0.0
    return levenshtein_distance(ref_words, hyp_words) / len(ref_words)
```

**CER vs WER:**

| Metric | Granularity | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| CER | Character | Fine-grained OCR evaluation |
| WER | Word | Document-level OCR, ASR |

For multilingual OCR with varying scripts (not all have "words"), CER is more universally applicable.

### 9.4 Exact Match Accuracy

```python
def exact_match(reference: str, hypothesis: str) -> float:
    return 1.0 if reference == hypothesis else 0.0
```

**Why this metric?**

- Binary: either exact match or not
- Complementary to CER/WER (which measure partial errors)
- Useful for: "What % of samples are 100% correct?"

## 10) Checkpoint System Deep Dive

### 10.1 What's Saved in Checkpoint

```python
ckpt = {
    "epoch": epoch + 1,
    "model_state_dict": model.state_dict(),
    "optimizer_state_dict": optimizer.state_dict(),
    "char_to_idx": char_to_idx,      # Vocabulary mapping
    "idx_to_char": idx_to_char,      # Reverse vocabulary
    "best_val_loss": best_val_loss,
    "patience_count": patience_count,
    "train_losses": train_losses,    # Historical metrics
    "val_losses": val_losses,
    "train_cers": train_cers,
    "val_cers": val_cers,
    "train_wers": train_wers,
    "val_wers": val_wers,
    "train_accs": train_accs,
    "val_accs": val_accs,
    "config": vars(cfg),             # Training config
}
```

**Why save all this?**

| Component | Why |
|------------|-----|
| model_state_dict | Restore model weights |
| optimizer_state_dict | Continue training from exact point |
| char_to_idx / idx_to_char | Ensure vocabulary consistency |
| best_val_loss | Track best performance |
| patience_count | Continue early stopping logic |
| train/val_* arrays | Keep plots/reports continuous |
| config | Reproducibility |

### 10.2 Best vs Latest Checkpoint

```python
# Save latest every epoch
torch.save(ckpt, ckpt_dir / "latest_checkpoint.pth")

# Save best only on improvement
if val_metrics["loss"] < best_val_loss:
    best_val_loss = val_metrics["loss"]
    patience_count = 0
    torch.save(ckpt, ckpt_dir / "best_checkpoint.pth")
```

**Why two checkpoints?**

```
latest_checkpoint.pth:
- Always available (updated every epoch)
- Used for: resume after crash, continue training
- May not be the best model

best_checkpoint.pth:
- Updated only when val_loss improves
- Used for: final evaluation, deployment
- Always the best model seen
```

### 10.3 Resume Logic

```python
# Key concepts for resume:
# 1. Load checkpoint state dict
# 2. Validate vocabulary matches
# 3. Validate config compatibility
```
- For CLI usage, see README

**Why vocabulary validation?**

If you change dataset (different languages):
- Old checkpoint has vocabulary ["a", "b", "c"]
- New dataset has vocabulary ["x", "y", "z"]
- Model output indices won't match labels
- Solution: fail fast with clear error message

**Edge Cases Handled:**

| Edge Case | Handling |
|----------|---------|
| Missing checkpoint file | Raise FileNotFoundError |
| Vocabulary mismatch | Raise ValueError with details |
| Different image size | Raise ValueError |
| Different model type | Raise ValueError |
| Corrupted checkpoint | Raise RuntimeError |
| Missing optimizer state | Warn, continue with random optimizer |

**What Gets Restored:**

| Component | Restored From |
|-----------|--------------|
| Model weights | `model_state_dict` |
| Optimizer state | `optimizer_state_dict` |
| Epoch number | `epoch` |
| Best val loss | `best_val_loss` |
| Patience counter | `patience_count` |
| Training history | `train_losses`, `val_losses`, etc. |

**What Doesn't Get Restored:**

- Training history (loss curves start fresh, but logs are appended)
- DataLoader state (iterators restart)

---

### 10.4 Checkpoint Best Practices

**When to Use Which Checkpoint:**

| Checkpoint | Use Case |
|------------|----------|
| `latest_checkpoint.pth` | Resume after crash |
| `best_checkpoint.pth` | Final evaluation, deployment |

**Best Practices:**

1. **Always keep latest_checkpoint**: Updated every epoch
2. **Use best_checkpoint for inference**: Best validation performance
3. **Don't delete old checkpoints**: Until new one performs better

**Example Workflow:**

```bash
# Training crashes at epoch 45
# Use latest to resume
python3 train_swin_multilingual.py --resume

# Best was epoch 40
# Use best for inference
python3 inference.py --model ./checkpoints/best_checkpoint.pth
```

## 11) Performance Optimization Deep Dive

### 11.1 Gradient Clipping

```python
torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_norm=2.0)
```

**Why needed for OCR?**

```
CTC loss characteristics:
- Can produce very large gradients
- Particularly in early training
- Large gradients -> unstable training -> NaN

How clipping works:
- Compute gradient norm: ||g||
- If ||g|| > max_norm: scale down
- g_clipped = g * (max_norm / ||g||)
```

**Why max_norm=2.0?**

```
Too small (< 1.0):
- Overly aggressive clipping
- Might slow down learning

Too large (> 5.0):
- Insufficient clipping
- Might not prevent explosions

2.0 is a sweet spot:
- OCR-specific value (from literature)
- Allows learning while preventing explosion
- Works well for both Swin and CRNN
```

### 11.2 AMP (Automatic Mixed Precision)

**How AMP works:**

```
Without AMP (FP32):
- All computations in 32-bit floating point
- Standard, accurate, but slower

With AMP (FP16 + FP32):
- Forward pass: FP16 where possible
- Backward pass: FP16 where possible
- FP32 for: loss scaling, optimizer states, master weights
- GradScaler handles FP16 -> FP32 conversion
```

**Code flow:**

```python
scaler = GradScaler()  # Initialize scaler

# Forward pass in FP16
with autocast(device_type='cuda'):
    logits = model(images)
    log_probs = logits.log_softmax(2)
    loss = criterion(log_probs, targets, input_lengths, target_lengths)

# Backward pass with scaling
scaler.scale(loss).backward()
scaler.unscale_(optimizer)  # Unscale for gradient clipping
torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_norm=2.0)
scaler.step(optimizer)     # Unscale and update
scaler.update()            # Update scaler state
```

**Why use AMP?**

| Aspect | FP32 | FP16+AMP |
|--------|------|----------|
| Memory | 100% | ~50-70% |
| Speed | 1x | ~1.5-2x |
| Accuracy | Baseline | ~same |

**When to use AMP:**

- Always beneficial on modern GPUs (Turing+)
- Especially useful when: limited VRAM, want larger batches
- Default: off (for maximum compatibility with older GPUs)

### 11.3 DataLoader Performance

**persistent_workers=True:**

```python
DataLoader(
    dataset,
    num_workers=4,
    persistent_workers=True,  # Workers stay alive between epochs
)
```

**How it works:**
```
Without persistent_workers:
- Epoch 1: spawn workers
- Epoch 1 end: kill workers
- Epoch 2: spawn workers again
- ...repeat

With persistent_workers:
- Epoch 1: spawn workers
- Epoch 1 end: keep workers alive
- Epoch 2: reuse workers (no spawn/kill overhead)
- ...repeat

Savings: ~0.5-2 seconds per epoch (depending on workers)
```

**prefetch_factor=2:**

```
Without prefetch:
- Worker fetches batch 1 -> GPU processes -> Worker fetches batch 2 -> ...

With prefetch_factor=2:
- Worker fetches batch 1, 2, 3 (keeps 2 ahead)
- GPU processes batch 1
- Worker fetches batch 4 (continues prefetching)
- ...

Benefit: hides data loading latency
Best for: fast GPUs that can outpace CPU data loading
```

### 11.4 cuDNN Benchmark

```python
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = True
```

**How it works:**
- On first run, cuDNN benchmarks different convolution algorithms
- Selects the fastest for your specific input size/model
- Caches the result for subsequent runs

**Trade-offs:**
- First epoch slower (benchmarking)
- Subsequent epochs faster (5-15% speedup)
- Non-deterministic results (different algorithm each run)
- Enable for training, disable for exact reproducibility
